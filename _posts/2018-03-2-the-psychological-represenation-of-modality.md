[Phillips, J. & Knobe, J. (2018). The psychological representation of modality. *Mind & Language*](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mila.12165/epdf?author_access_token=YJnNrFUAHiD7X5BtHmsIj4ta6bR2k8jH0KrdpFOxC64rx2YI4yXf1_8mGQ0hiYO-w0urnuJ4dLkVIauHAml-r0hqWGYPqnVDAvJ8gWAgNJZM3RBNuGDXOT6H2UeJmimr).
 
I think of this paper as a sort of birth certificate for the growing body of work on the psychological representaiton of modality. Its the place where its name was first written down, alongside some acknowledgement of its theoretical predecessors, and its place of origin. Similar to a birth certificate, it also marks the beginning of something that while perhaps now viable on its own, is really just beginning to develop. In some ways it asks more questions than it answers, but I also think it outlines the nacent form of what those answers are going to look like in twenty or so years.

The paper consists of basically five parts. The head of the paper is an introduction to the idea of the psychological representation of modality. The four other parts talk about the work that this can do in four distinct domains: (1) the developement of understanding possibility, (2) judgments of force and freedom, (3) causal judgments, and (4) counterfactual reasoning. 





**Abstract**
A series of recent studies have explored the impact of people’s judgments regarding physical law, morality, and probability. Surprisingly, such studies indicate that these three apparently unrelated types of judgments often have precisely the same impact. We argue that these findings provide evidence for a more general hypothesis about the kind of cognition people use to think about possibilities. Specifically, we suggest that this aspect of people’s cognition is best understood using an idea developed within work in the formal semantics tradition, namely the notion of modality. On the view we propose, people may have separate representations for physical, moral and probabilistic considerations, but they also integrate these various considerations into a unified representation of modality.
