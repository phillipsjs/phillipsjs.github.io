My research falls in the intersection of psychology, philosophy, and linguistics, and probably only really fits comfortably under broader umbrella of cognitive science. Much of the work I've done is related in one way or another to the psychological representation of modality &mdash; the way our minds represent and reason over possibilities. I have also done a fair amount of thinking about the theory of mind, causal reasoning, moral judgment, formal semantics, and happiness. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Psychology and Philosophy at Yale in 2015, and I'm currently a post doc with Fiery Cushman in the [Moral Psychology Research Lab](http://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard.
