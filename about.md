My research falls in the intersection of psychology, philosophy, and linguistics. For better or worse, it probably only fits comfortably under the broader umbrella of cognitive science.

I got my Ph.D. in Psychology and Philosophy at Yale in 2015, and I'm currently a post doc with Fiery Cushman in the [Moral Psychology Research Lab](http://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard.
