I am an Assitant Professor in [Cognitive Science at Dartmouth College](https://cognitive-science.dartmouth.edu/), and am affiliated with the departments of [Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/) and [Philosophy](https://philosophy.dartmouth.edu/). Before starting at Dartmouth, I received my Ph.D. in Psychology and Philosophy at Yale and then spent some time as a post doc with Fiery Cushman in the [Moral Psychology Research Lab](http://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard.

My research falls in the intersection of psychology, philosophy, and linguistics. For better or worse, it probably only fits comfortably under the broader umbrella of cognitive science.


You can find out more about the research I've done [here](http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~phillips01) and see what our lab is currently up to [here]().
